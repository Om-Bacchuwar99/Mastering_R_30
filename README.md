# 📊 Mastering R in 30 Days

### 📝 Project Overview
This repository is a comprehensive, day-by-day documentation of my journey into the R programming language. Following the **WsCube Tech** curriculum, I am building a foundation in data science by committing to daily practice, documentation, and code uploads.

### 🎯 Learning Goals
* Master R syntax and core data structures (Vectors, Matrices, Data Frames).
* Implement data manipulation using the **Tidyverse** ecosystem.
* Create professional-grade visualizations with **ggplot2**.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic statistical modeling.
