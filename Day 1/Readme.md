### 🛈 About R Language

* Unlike other Compiled programming language(whole program is compiled in one go), R is the Interpreted computer programming Language(compiles the program by line).
* It is the software environment used to analyze statistical information, graphical representation, reporting and data modeling.
* Trending Technologies are also implemented using the R programming language.
* R have the rich statistical libraries.
* It is combined with lexical scoping semantics.
* It is a part of the GNU free software project.





### 🏛️History of R Programming Language



* R was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the University of Auckland, New Zealand.
* The name of this language was taken from the developers.
* The stable beta version (i.e 1.0.0) was released in 2000  .
* Latest version of R version 4.5.2 has been release on 31st October 2025.
* R is the modern implementation of S programming language. Where S language was commercial.





### ⚙️Features of R Programming Language

* R is comprehensive programming language that supports both procedural programming language (i.e C ) as well as Object-Oriented programming language (i.e C++).
* It can be easily integrated with many other technologies and frameworks like Hadoop and HDFS.
* It is an open-source programming language.
* We can even create, customize and modify our own package.
* As it has the variety of packages , there are more than 15K packages for R on the online repositories like CRAN and GitHub.
* It's graphical capabilities are amazing. With added ggplot2 and plotly the possibilities are endless.
* It is cross-platform supportive that it can run on any OS.
* It performs fast calculations. We can perform a wide variety of complex operations on vectors, arrays, data frames and other data objects of varying sizes.





### 🤖֎ Machine Learning with R Language

* There is MLR package which stands for Machine Learning in R which has became highly popular.
* This package is useful for all machine learning algorithms and provides other tools that help with machine learning as well.





### 🤔Reason to learn R language❓

* With R, we can perform statistical analysis, data analysis as well as machine learning.
* We can create objects, functions and packages in it. R is platform-independent can be used across multiple OS with it's variety of packages.
* The big data world is also accessible to R. WE can connect R with different databases like Spark or Hadoop.
* There are about 2M+ Job opening for R programmers worldwide. Companies hire R programmers for many roles like Data Analysts, Business Analysts, Data Visualization experts and Business Intelligence experts.
* The most profound industry that makes use of R is Data Science industry, like Health, Finance, Banking, Manufacturing and Many more industries are using R.
* For Machine learning the best algorithms can be implemented with R. Keras and Tensorflow allow us to create high-end machine learning techniques. It has package to perform Xgboost.







### ⚠️Check the 🛠️Installation Guide file (for completing the installation)✅







### 🖥️First Steps in R (RStudio vs. R Editor)

* R Console (RStudio): This is used for "interactive" programming where you type a line of code and hit Enter to see the result immediately.
* R Editor (Script Window): This is where you write multiple lines of code to save as a program.
* Execution Shortcut: To run code from the Editor, highlight the text and press Ctrl + R to send it to the console.
* Comments: Use the # symbol to write comments that the program will ignore.





### 📝Writing Your First Script

* Printing Text: You can print strings by simply typing them in quotes, like "Hello World", or using the formal print() function.
* The Assignment Operator: In R, the <- (left arrow) is the standard way to assign values to variables.
* While the = sign works, <- is the industry preference for R programming.
* Dynamic Typing: You do not need to declare if a variable is a number or text; R understands it automatically based on the value you provide.



### 🔢Basic Math and Logic in R

* Direct Calculation: R can be used as a simple calculator by typing operations like 10 + 20 directly into the console.
* Variable Operations: You can store values in variables and perform math on them:

a <- 10

b <- 20

sum <- a + b

print(sum)

* Handling Results: The results of these operations are displayed in the console with a \[1] prefix, indicating the index of the first element.
